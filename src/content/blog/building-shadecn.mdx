description: How I built a tool to make SVGs work seamlessly with shadcn themes
---

I love using unDraw illustrations in my projects, but I'm way too lazy to manually change their colors to match my shadcn themes.

So I built [shadecn](https://github.com/johanwulf/shadecn) to fix exactly this problem (awesome name, right?).

## The Problem

When you export SVGs from Figma or other design tools, you get something like this:

```jsx
<svg fill="#8b5cf6" stroke="#3b82f6">
  <path d="..." />
</svg>
```

Those hex colors are baked in. They don't respond to theme changes, and they probably don't match your design system anyway.

## The Solution

shadecn lets you import your shadcn theme CSS and map those hard-coded colors to your theme variables. Instead of `fill="#8b5cf6"`, you get `fill="hsl(var(--primary))"`.

Here's how it works:

1. Paste your SVG
2. Import your shadcn theme config (the CSS with all those OKLCH colors)
3. Map which SVG colors should use which theme colors
4. Export a React component that adapts to your theme

## Tech Stack

Built with React, TypeScript, and of course shadcn/ui components. Using Tailwind CSS for styling and Vite for the build process. The color conversion magic happens with culori.

It's live at [wulf.gg/shadecn](https://wulf.gg/shadecn) and the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/johanwulf/shadecn).

## Why I Built This

Honestly, I just got tired of manually editing SVG colors every time I wanted to use an illustration in a project. Now I can paste an SVG, map it to my theme, and get a component that just works everywhere.
