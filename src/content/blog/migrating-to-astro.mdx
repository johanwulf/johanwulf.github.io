description: How I migrated my personal website from Vite + React to Astro
---

After struggling with complex MDX configurations and build tool conflicts, I decided to migrate my personal website to Astro.

## The Problem

I started with a Vite + React + MDX setup, which seemed like a good idea at first. But as I added more features, the complexity grew:

- PostCSS and Tailwind CSS v4 conflicts
- Complex MDX configuration with multiple plugins
- Manual routing for blog posts
- Heavy JavaScript bundle for a mostly static site

## Enter Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that's perfect for content-focused websites. Here's what sold me:

### Zero JavaScript by Default

Unlike traditional React apps, Astro ships zero JavaScript by default. Your pages are fully rendered at build time.

### Built-in MDX Support

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()]
})
```

### Content Collections

Astro's content collections provide type-safe content management:

```typescript
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content'

const blogCollection = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    description: z.string().optional(),
  }),
})
```

## The Migration Process

The migration was surprisingly smooth:

1. **Created Astro project structure**
   - Pages go in `src/pages/`
   - Layouts in `src/layouts/`
   - Blog posts in `src/content/blog/`

2. **Converted React components to Astro**
   - Most components became `.astro` files
   - Kept React only for interactive components

## The Results

The page you are looking at!

## Code Example

Here's how simple a blog post page is in Astro:

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from '../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro'
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content'

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getCollection('blog')
  return posts.map(post => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
    props: { post },
  }))
}

const { post } = Astro.props
const { Content } = await post.render()
---

<BaseLayout title={post.data.title}>
  <article>
    <h1>{post.data.title}</h1>
    <Content />
  </article>
</BaseLayout>
```
